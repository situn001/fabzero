The vinyl cutter model we have at AS220 Labs is a Roland Camm-1 CX-24.
A vinyl cutter is a uses a computer-controlled blade to cut out shapes designed using vector graphics. The vinyl cutter is primarily used for cutting vinyl into signs or stickers, but can also be used to cut copper tape into circuit traces.
Your vinyl cutter files must contain only vectors.
The vectors must be lines only, with no fill.
The vinyl cutter drivers can only interpret cut lines.
All vectors must be contained within the bounds of the document canvas.
Document Setup 
You will need to size your page in your drawing program appropriately for the width of vinyl that you are using. Vinyl comes in two widths, 24" and 15".
Machine rollers will take up 1" on either side of the vinyl.
Select a roll of vinyl and place it on the rollers behind the machine.
