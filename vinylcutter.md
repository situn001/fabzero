The vinyl cutter model we have at AS220 Labs is a Roland Camm-1 CX-24.
A vinyl cutter is a uses a computer-controlled blade to cut out shapes designed using vector graphics. The vinyl cutter is primarily used for cutting vinyl into signs or stickers, but can also be used to cut copper tape into circuit traces.
Your vinyl cutter files must contain only vectors.
The vectors must be lines only, with no fill.
The vinyl cutter drivers can only interpret cut lines.
All vectors must be contained within the bounds of the document canvas.
Document Setup 
You will need to size your page in your drawing program appropriately for the width of vinyl that you are using. Vinyl comes in two widths, 24" and 15".
Machine rollers will take up 1" on either side of the vinyl.
Select a roll of vinyl and place it on the rollers behind the machine.
On the back right of the machine you will see a lever; place it in the "down" position so you can load the vinyl.
Make sure the vinyl side is facing up as you feed it through the rollers into the vinyl cutter.
Under the rubber wheels there is a white sticker indicator.
Ensure that the vinyl is aligned properly under the rubber wheels.
The left wheel must always be under the wide white sticker on the left
