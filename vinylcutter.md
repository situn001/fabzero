1.A vinyl cutter is a uses a computer-controlled blade to cut out shapes designed using vector graphics. The vinyl cutter is primarily used for cutting vinyl into signs or stickers, but can also be used to cut copper tape into circuit traces.

This tutorial uses Inkscape to prepare files for the vinyl cutter. 
2.A vinyl cutter is a uses a computer-controlled blade to cut out shapes designed using vector graphics. The vinyl cutter is primarily used for cutting vinyl into signs or stickers, but can also be used to cut copper tape into circuit traces.  
3.Your vinyl cutter files must contain only vectors. 
4.The vectors must be lines only, with no fill.
The vinyl cutter drivers can only interpret cut lines.
All vectors must be contained within the bounds of the document canvas.
Document Setup 
You will need to size your page in your drawing program appropriately for the width of vinyl that you are using. Vinyl comes in two widths, 24" and 15".
Machine rollers will take up 1" on either side of the vinyl.
Select a roll of vinyl and place it on the rollers behind the machine.
On the back right of the machine you will see a lever; place it in the "down" position so you can load the vinyl.
Make sure the vinyl side is facing up as you feed it through the rollers into the vinyl cutter.
Under the rubber wheels there is a white sticker indicator.
Ensure that the vinyl is aligned properly under the rubber wheels.
The left wheel must always be under the wide white sticker on the left
The right rubber wheel must be under any one of the three white stickers on the right, depending on the width of your vinyl. 
Make sure your vinyl is straight and about 2-3 inches past the rubber wheels.
After inserting the vinyl into the machine, pull up the lever at the back of the machine to ensure that the vinyl is securly loaded.
# Turn On the Vinyl Cutter / Final Steps
On the left side of the vinyl cutter is the power button.

Turn it on.

Now you will notice on the screen it says "select roll".

Press the enter button.

The vinyl cutter will measure the width of the roll (in mm). Take note of the measurement, you many need to adjust the width of your file depending on the measured width of the vinyl.

Set the origin by pressing the "Origin" button on the control panel.
# Print to the Vinyl Cutter
To print the file, go to File > Print > select the "vinyl cuter" driver from the print menu.

Hit the "print" button to send the file to the vinyl cutter.

The vinyl cutter will begin printing once you send the print job.

After the vinyl cutter is done cutting your file, use scissors to cut off the section with your cut design.
# Weed the Vinyl
 "Weeding" the cut vinyl is the process of removing the unwanted areas from the final cut design.

Gather Your Tools
Transfer Tape
Scissors
X-Acto knife
Tweezers
Trim
After cutting, trim area you want to keep with scissors.

Weed
Then remove the unwanted parts of vinyl with an X-Axcto knife and / or tweezers.
# Transfer to the Desired Surface
Carefully apply transer tape to the surface of the weeded vinyl. Rub the transfer tape onto the vinyl to form a strong bond between the tape and the top surface of the vinyl design.

After rubbing, carefully pull the transfer tape (with the vinyl adhering to it) away from the vinyl paper backing.

After you have removed the vinyl from the paper backing and it is attached to the transfer tape, apply it to the desired surface. Rub the surface of the transfer tape to ensure that the vinyl will adhere to the new surface.

Carefully pull the transfer tape away from the vinyl, leaving the vinyl attached to the desired surface.

Then we created username and user email in the git login After the Successfull installation we did cloning of the readme file by copying the address and then we tried updating the file and then we saved the file by commit and then pushing the file to the repository. Then we have started taking pictures of the equipment's and uploading in the repository. After that we had lunch break. After the lunch break we sorted out inventory of electronic devices. Next Mentor briefed us about the functionality of the 3D Printer, unloading of the filament, cleaning of the waste, cooling procedure of the printer, etc. And next Mentor briefed us about the Vinyl cutter, how to load the sheet, how to keep the edge points on the sheet. Next we had tea break. We installed 3DWOX software for 3D printing Did all the documentation of today's work in the reposito
