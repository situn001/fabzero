# ShopBot
Computer Numerical Control (CNC)) is an automated control of machining tools used for drills, boring tools, lathes etc. by means of a computer. This machine alters a blank piece of material usually wood or any other soft material which can retain its shape to meet precise specifications by following programmed instructions and without a manual operation.
The shopbot is a subtractive machice.  
Shopbot  machines combine a motorized movable tool or platform, which can be controlled by a computer operation with specific input instructions. Instructions are delivered to the machine through designs made in the computer which are transformed into a sequential machine instructions and then executed.
shopbot is a machine which operates in 3 axis. The basic operation of shopbot is to fabricated wooden material or any other soft material which can hold its shape during the process of fabrication. It contains a milling bit which as per the programming assigned provides the required shapes in all the three dimensions. The shopbot at FAB Lab is of its dimensions are 96 inches x 48 inches. shopbot is attached with a dust collector which during the process of fabrication collects the dust emitted from the material under fabrication.The shopbot drill bit RPM is upto 14000RPM.
Use of SHOPBOT
-Always wear safety glasses when operating the ShopBot or observing the machine when it is in use. 
-Never leave the machine when it is in operation. 
-If you need a bathroom break, the machine can be paused by pressing the Space Bar on the control PC keyboard. 
-Make sure the bed of the machine is clean before use. Inform us if it is not clean. 
-Securely fasten your material to the bed of the machine. Consult us every time you are faced with a different, challenging or unusual work-holding scenario. 
-Perform command “C3” Homing routine to establish the true machine home X-0 Y-0 (in the machine coordinates system) 
-Jog X, Y to your personal Work Home coordinates, ie: the corner of your material & the X,Y origin of your drawing. 
- Work Home X Y coordinates are simply offset measurements from the true Home (X-0, Y-0) of the Machine. 
-Zero work coordinates to X-0 Y-0 
-Install tool in collet/tool holder + install tool/tool holder on spindle. 
-Visually check again the machine bed to ensure all tools have been removed and that material is securely fastened to the bed. 
-Start in ShopBot software, follow prompts. 
-Start the spindle with the green button on the ShopBot remote. 
-Monitor the machine closely until the machine stops. Laser Cutters and CNC Routers have a high risk of fire if left unattended. 
-If you need to pause the machine, press the Spacebar on the PC Keyboard. The machine will pause, then follow the prompts to restart or end the process. 
-Emergency stop (E-stop) buttons are located in 2 places: On your remote, next to the Control PC, and On the end of the Y - Axis gantry. The Emergency Stop buttons are large, round Red buttons which will completely shut-down the machine. 
-Remove the tool-holder & tool from the spindle and store it in the tool-holder rack. 
-Clean the machine and your work area completely after you have removed your material. 
-Skeletons and scraps created during the process should be cut up & placed in the recycling cart. 
Run command C2. Put the metal plate under the machine head and connect the alligator grip to the tool head. Run Enter. The machine will go down and adjust its Z zero. 
Run command C3. The machine will move. Wait. Done.
